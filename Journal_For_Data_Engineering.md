## Learning Git: Chapters 1 and 2

"Git was created by Linus Torvalds to version control the work done on a large software development project called the Linux kernel." Did pushing and pulling exist when Git was created? How did Git work without an online remote repository?

I viewed Git configurations with `git config --global --list` and cleaned up `~/.gitconfig` manually. What are commands to edit `.gitconfig` safely? How do I use a Git-based email address?

## The Linux Command Line: Chapters 1 - 5

I appreciated learning tricks like using `cd -` to return to a previous directory. I appreciated understanding the application of symbolic links to, for example, naming a symbolic link `configuration.json` and having that symbolic link point to `configuration_from_2024-05-29.json`.
