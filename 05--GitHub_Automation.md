# GitHub Automation

I feel powerful after using GitHub Actions to automate testing of 31 tests. I minimized Makefile, minimized manual processing of texts, used fixtures and tests to process texts, used a complex command stored in a shell script, and printed a log after a test failed when the test was not expected to fail.
