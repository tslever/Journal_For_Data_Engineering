I appreciate Efrain Olivares's overview of DBT. DBT is a package and Software as a Service. DBT provides access to multiple DataBase Management Systems (DBMS) such as Snowflake, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. DBT allows seeding data to Snowflake. DBT allows creating SQL statements / DBT models that are able to be tracked using Git. DBT allows testing data. Is a DBT model an SQL statement or a script containing a single SQL SELECT statement?
