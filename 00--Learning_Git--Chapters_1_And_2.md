# Learning Git: Chapters 1 and 2

"Git was created by Linus Torvalds to version control the work done on a large software development project called the Linux kernel." Did pushing and pulling exist when Git was created? How did Git work without an online remote repository?

I viewed Git configurations with `git config --global --list` and cleaned up `~/.gitconfig` manually. What are commands to edit `.gitconfig` safely? How do I use a Git-based email address?
