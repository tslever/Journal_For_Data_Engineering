To quote SW Skills 2 Quiz, "When starting out learning and applying Design Patterns it is important to use sparingly, and apply a design pattern only after attempting a simple and direct solution first". I would like to have a better sense of when to code simply and when to apply a design pattern. Basically, I would like to work at a high level but still with or under a Software Engineer who can make architectural decisions. I would also like to practice applying design patterns more, and understand why example code is written the way it is.
