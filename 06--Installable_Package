This week, I cleaned text after installing a version of package `wordprocessors` from GitHub. I installed the version using `pip install git+http://github.com/tslever/wordprocessors@WEEK-06/installable_package`. I adapted the package by transitioning from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`, having package `src` import the contents of package `pkg_dpy8wq`, and having `pkg_dpy8wq` import the contents of module `word_processors`.
