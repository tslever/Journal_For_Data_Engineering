On AWS, is a security group associated with our class account, a user like me, or an EC2 instance? Does a security group need to allow communication with GitHub before running `eval "ssh-agent -s"` and `ssh-add ~/.ssh/Tom_Levers_EC2_Instance_For_Data_Engineering_GitHub_Key`? How do I limit traffic to just SSH with my GitHub account or one repository?
