This week I learned to use the Snowflake data warehousing platform. I appreciated the theoretical ability to have multiple administrators, users, databases, schemas, and tables. I appreciated the theoretical ability to store database in formats other than relational databases. I appreciated the theoretical ability to store lots of data online.

I learned to attach to a data warehouse and use the online dbt Integrated Development Environment. I would prefer to use Snowflake on Linux or Windows.
